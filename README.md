# Asteroids
My take on the classic Asteroids game, using Python.

### Motivation
I have been experimenting with Python recently (coming from a JavaScript background) and I've been learning a lot about classes and OOP. I'm a big fan of games and I stumbled across the Pygame library while going through a tutorial so I thought I would give it a go and this is the result.

### Quick Start
* Make sure you have Python installed
* Clone the repo
* Run `python3 main.py`

### Todos
* Add a scoring system
* Implement multiple lives and respawning
* Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
* Add acceleration to the player movement
* Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
* Add a background image
* Create different weapon types
* Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
* Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
* Add a shield power-up
* Add a speed power-up
* Add bombs that can be dropped
